Years back, a gentleman called Ramdev Baba started a campaign and he gained the popularity by conducting YOGA shivir across India. We as an Indian citizen must appraise Baba that he started infusing the social, medical & political issue while performing YOGA classes. And its been welcome by millions of individual & entity. The impact of Baba’s Yoga & speech has been observed as most successful initiative in the history of India. Thousands of people benefited by Baba, and I’m sure our society can never forgot that.

But the twist has come in the show last week when people witnessed a dramatic & controversial end of his movement against corruption in India & black money. We must acknowledge the fact that his initiative was in favor of the country and system which governs us but why it turned to be quite a dull & uninspiring affair?

Now, the question is where was loophole, planning or execution. I would say it’s planning. Most sensitive issue in India is not been planned as well as executed properly. I’m sure in near future there is a very rare chance to encounter with baba but definitely through my blog I must ask :

* You would have revel the demand sheet with media and civil society at first place before the fast at Ramleela Maidan. Why you expanded the list of demand post meeting with Govt representative?

* You should surrender on the stage instead of trying to escape in women outfit? And latter you tried to defend your action by taking the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji which I believe was wrong.

There was absolutely no need to run away from the police in women outfit.

* In the regular press conference at aashram you have mentioned several times that “There was a plan to kill me”. Here I can say with guarantee that NO, there can not be such plan.

* You have mentioned in the open press conference that you are going to raise an army of 11,000 youth to take on government by “Shastra” & “Shhashtra”. Does it make any sense?

In brief, Baba haven’t played his card carefully. Now Baba, I would interpret the events and I do have a piece of advice :

* At first place, you must hire a professional advisor to advice your team to tackle the situation.

* Never call a press conference in hurry & deliver a controversial statement. It will spoil your image.

* The job that you were doing was greatest ever job for civil society. Give a new birth to your flagship movement for betterment of society.

* Corruption & black money issue can not be solved overnight so lets plan & execute together.

* By circumstances, I got a understanding that you living in a imaginary world rather than practical world.

* Spend the people’s donated money for the right cause.

On a positive note, I would expect that Baba will be giving his service like before to civil society.

JAI HIND JAI BHARAT.
