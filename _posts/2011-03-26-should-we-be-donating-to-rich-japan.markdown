Japan is an industrialized and one of the most well equipped nation on earth to cop with such calamities (they argue).
As per recent update 4,289 people have so far confirmed dead and 7,548 are still missing in Japan.
As per my view “MISERY” would be an understatement to describe the suffering of the victim of Japan’s. Many are without food, water and struggling in between life and death. Individual and entity across the world are opening up their wallets, seeking to provide some relief through various not-for-profit organization.
When we talking about electronic media, if you type “JAPAN” in Google there will be various links to the websites which will take you the donation page with very emotional phrases.

But the question is “ARE THE OUTFLOW OF FUNDS REACHING TO RIGHT HANDS?” There are currently countless charities which are taking donations for the disaster but they are not working in the country say they will fund trusted local charities who are responding to the crisis.

As a human being and responsible citizen, we must help the individual without any philosophical judgment.  It is obvious that you want to help when you see the terrible scenes, but this is what causes the massive flow of money in a major sudden disaster much of which is unspent. And these mass flow of donations can often result in a mess of uncoordinated international charities  parachuting(who may have good intention).
There is not clear answer whether you should give or not?

But if you do decide to leave moral dilemma of humanitarian aid and its effectiveness in a major disaster of the equation then perhaps follow some basic principle :

(1) Legitimate charities seldom solicit funds by telephone. They never ask for donations by email. Emails soliciting relief funds often appear legitimate but contain links to bogus sites set up by the fraudsters.
Legitimate charities and not-for-profit groups have websites ending with “.org” or “.ca”, and never “.com” or “.net”.

(2) Watch out for the spelling of the domain name. The bogus sites often utilize misspelled words or words in a different order to confuse the victim.

(3) Be wary of links posted on social media sites, for example, those shortened links posted on Twitter, especially if you’re browsing through your mobile phone. The small screen makes it difficult to judge the legitimacy of any site that you visit.

(4) Go through legitimate media portals, such as cbc.ca/japanrelief, to enter the websites of the charities of your choice. Even search engines may mistakenly bring up bogus sites through the careful manipulation of the fraudsters.
