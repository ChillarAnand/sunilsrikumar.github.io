Facebook users’ personal information could have been accidentally leaked to third parties, in particular advertisers, over the past few years.

Third-parties would have had access to personal information such as profiles, photographs and chat, and could have had the ability to post messages.

Over the years, hundreds of thousands of applications may have inadvertently leaked millions of access tokens to third parties and Facebook was notified of this issue and has confirmed the leakage.

Facebook has more than 500 million users and is challenging Google Inc and Yahoo Inc for users’ time online and for advertising dollars.
