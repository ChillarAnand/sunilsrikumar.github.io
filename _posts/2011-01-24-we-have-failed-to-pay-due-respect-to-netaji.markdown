Its 23rd January, many people would have already stressed the mind that so what is different???
And being an Indian citizen, I must say that we have failed to pay due respect to one of our great freedom fighter, NETAJI SUBHAS CHANDRA BOSE. At the same time I believe that it’s a regret for the every country man that we forgot the greatest leader who given us the opportunity to breath in free country.

AND TO BE MORE PRECISE WITH ALL INDIAN, FREEDOM DOESN’T COME FREE, UNCOUNTABLE INDIVIDUAL LOST THEIR LIVES, UNCOUNTABLE CHILD LOST THEIR PARENTS, UNCOUNTABLE FREEDOM FIGHTER & BEST LEADER LOST THEIR LIVES WHO SYNONYM FREEDOM AS A DULHAN.

I believes many of our current generation doesn’t know when Netaji born, forget about his ideology. Most importantly Netaji was one of the key leader in post nation building activities.

It’s a time to review our thought process.Till yet I haven’t got the answer of one question that why Netaji not been recognize like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar patel. I believe, his contribution to the Indian freedom struggle is at par with the Mahatma, but still in the official circles he is never spoken of in the same vein as Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru or Sardar Vallabhai Patel. The man who quit the prestigious Indian Civil Service, risked his life to flee the nation to raise an armed struggle against the mighty British rulers of India certainly doesn’t deserve the snub being meted out.

Through this blog, I do not wish any award and recognition from any individual or government for Netaji. Just I appeal every patriotic Indian that initiate a process to inject his ideology in the society and that would be a best salute for him.

JAI HIND JAI BHARAT.
