Just few minute back, I come to know that from a most authenticate news agency that In America some small church burning a copy of KORAN & they synonym as “INTER-NATION BURN A KORAN DAY” for 9/11 tragedy.

Before writing any letter I convey my heart felt condolences to the family members & other near and dear ones of those who have perished. In this our of grief whole world stands with the family who lost their members, country who lost their citizen. I’m absolutely clueless on the matter of incident that took place on 9/11 & still unable to find the valid reason behind it.

We as a human being need to find the individual, group, entity & country involved in such a shameful planning & execution which took hundreds of lives. But burning a KORAN is not justified specially in a place called church. We need to respect every individuals freedom, faith, religion. We can not encourage the people who involves such kind of activity.

This would completely contrary to value as Americans, that this country has been built on the notion of freedom and religious tolerance. I would say Its a time for us to fight the terrorism with collaborative approach.
